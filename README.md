Speakeasy is a concise and complete programming language meant for general purpose problem solving.

This programming language project focuses only on syntax, semantics, ecosystem guidance, etc and doesn't include an interpreter or compiler; for that, see [Torchbear](https://github.com/foundpatterns/torchbear) to get started.

## Aims

Speakeasy aims to make software development easier and more productive for every developer; seasoned veterans, curious users, adults, children, and so on.  Our scope includes the lessons and concepts from other languages and disciplines; and we'll set our sights on unifying them into a simple, well-ordered developer experience.

Through collaborative, wholistic development that leverages the best available engineering practices, we hope to make the most powerful programming language your grandmother's ever seen.

## Syntax 

[Our dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QK0xc3mmo) starts with the [PUC-Rio interpreter](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/) [Lua syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)#Syntax) for basic data structure and controls with additional functions fitting a broad range of use cases.  For more info, see [Torchbear's built-in modules](https://github.com/foundpatterns/torchbear#built-in-modules) and [Torchbear's bindings documentation](https://foundpatterns.github.io/torchbear-docs/index.html).

A new control syntax is currently in the planning and development phase.  Rust developers and programming language researchers are highly encouraged to get involved in the issue queue and [the Discord chat server](https://discord.gg/f6XSuWs).  The underlying mechanisms can be found in [Torchbear's Ullage environment issue](https://github.com/foundpatterns/torchbear/issues/234).

## Higher-level Interfaces

By laying a foundation with a comprehensive, "batteries included", text-based programming interface, other programming environments will be possible to further develop.  Please see [Lighttouch](https://github.com/foundpatterns/lighttouch) as a starting point; more info to follow.
